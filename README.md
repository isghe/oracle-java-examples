# Oracle Java Examples

Simple examples, showing how to connect to ORACLE DB, with Java ojdbc driver, and how to make inserts without polluting ORACLE environment.

It's important to understand that polluting the ORACLE environment, without closing the opened connection, at the end, it will lock the system.

# Examples
The examples are:
* `HelloWorld`:
Just a simple query to table `DUAL`;
* `WrongWay`:
Inserts data in table `TEST_INSERT`, in wrong way: opens the connection for each insert, without closing the connection. Because of that it's polluting the ORACLE environment with tons of SESSIONS_PER_USER, until the system resources run out!
* `CorrectWay`:
Just closes the balanced connection with the open ones. At least it's not polluting the ORACLE environment; but it's unnecessary opening and closing the connection for each insert;
* `GoodWay`:
Opens the connection to ORACLE only on time, closing it only one time at the end of the program;
* `BetterWay`:
One connection, one commit. (making on commit, it depends on what you need).

# Install

Download `ojdbc7.jar` from [jdbc-drivers-12c-downloads](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/jdbc-drivers-12c-downloads.html) and copy it in `lib/` folder.

To run the examples `WrongWay`, `CorrectWay`, `GoodWay`, `BetterWay`, execute the script in `sql/create-table_test_insert.sql`; it will create the table `TEST_INSERT` in your DB.

# Configure

Copy `Configure/Credentials-template.java` to `Configure/Credentials.java` and modify the credentials you need (url, user and password).

# Compile

`$ cd examples/HelloWorld`

`$ . ../../script/compile.sh`

# Run
`. ../../script/run.sh`

# Monitor
To monitor the SESSIONS_PER_USER execute the query in `sql/sessions_per_user.sql`
